# React Queue App

## Deployed at https://stellular-babka-c495bc.netlify.app

- A simple ticket queue application done as part of a coding interview. Made using React. 
- Has a user terminal where the user can generate the number of the next ticket. The ticket currently being served and the last ticket to be served will also be shown.
- Has 4 counters whose circular light represents whether the counter is busy. Clicking on a green (available) counter light makes a counter accept the next ticket. Clicking on a red (unavailable) counter light completes the current task for a counter and makes it available again.
